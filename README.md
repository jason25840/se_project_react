**Intro**

This is a Fullstack application design that utilizes the power of React, express, and MongoDb. The App allows users to establish a profile and add clothing items for different types of weather. The App then links the users location to a weather API and displays the current weather conditions. It will display the clothing options that would be comfortable to wear given the current weather conditions. 

The application also utilizes express in the back end to route users and new items to their respective databases for continued access. 

Features include multiple interactive forms with input elements and submit, save, and delete capabilities. Each form with input fields utilizes validation for required input criteria. There is a toggle switch that can convert local temperature between celcius and farenheit based on preference. clothing item cards can be clicked to focus specifically with a popup modal. Users can register, login, and logout. They can update their name and avatar for their profile. A user can like or unlike an item provided by other users. They can only delete items that they themselves have added to their profile.
